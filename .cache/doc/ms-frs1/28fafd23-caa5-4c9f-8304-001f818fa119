<div class="content"><p>The File Replication Service (FRS) Protocol is used to
replicate files and folders among servers on the network. This protocol enables
duplicate files and folders to be maintained on multiple servers. FRSÂ  is used
to maintain duplicate copies of data files in the system volume (SYSVOL) system
folders on multiple domain controllers in a domain. FRS is used to replicate
data files among Distributed File System (DFS) shares. Detailed technical
reference material for the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interfaces, packet
formats, and data structures required for interoperation using FRS are
provided.</p><p>Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are
normative. All other sections and examples in this specification are
