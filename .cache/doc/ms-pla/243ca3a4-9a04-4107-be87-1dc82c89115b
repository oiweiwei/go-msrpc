<div class="content"><p>The Resolve method, given another event trace data provider
or a collection of event trace data providers, updates the properties of the
original provider with information from one of the passed-in provider(s). If
only one provider is passed-in, information from that provider is used. If
multiple providers are passed-in, information is used from the first provider
in the collection that has the same value for the ITraceDataProvider::Guid property
as the original ITraceDataProvider. The Guid in this context refers to the COM
interface property which is used as a <a href="f43f48aa-80a5-4b39-971e-7b3ac0bd9d0d#gt_1a61d947-4d31-4365-b2b4-5249de682b56" data-linktype="relative-path">PLA-UID</a> and does not comply

</p><p>If no provider from the passed-in collection has the same
PLA-UID, the original provider is not updated. If the original provider is
updated, the DisplayName property of the original provider is overwritten by
the DisplayName of the passed-in provider, and the ValueMapItems in the Level,
KeywordsAny, and KeywordsAll properties of the passed-in provider replace the
ValueMapItems for the existing Level, KeywordsAny, and KeywordsAll properties
of the original provider. However, actual value of the Level, KeywordsAny, and
KeywordsAll properties are not overwritten. Consequently, the existing settings
are not lost; that is, if the level is 5, the symbolic names of all the levels
(which are stored as ValueMapItems) are added, but the value of the level
remains as 5. For ValueMaps, see section <a href="b028335d-97c1-4b1c-bc07-8748d4956b8a" data-linktype="relative-path">3.2.4.18</a>.</p><p>Because only one provider is used to update the original
provider, there is no possibility for conflicting or duplicate properties. </p><dl>
