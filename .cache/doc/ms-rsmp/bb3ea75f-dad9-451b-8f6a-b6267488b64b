called when the client has dereferenced the session. Note, however, that the
server might not yet have dereferenced the session, because one or more
interfaces might still be in process. The server, therefore, does not tear down
the session, but rather cleans up the session and releases the open session
reference, allowing the session to be ended when the last reference is removed.</p><p>If the client has an outstanding synchronous request, the
requests MUST be unwound and canceled.</p></div>
