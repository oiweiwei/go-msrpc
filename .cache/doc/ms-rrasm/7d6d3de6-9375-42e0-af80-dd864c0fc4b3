</dd></dl><p><b>dwMsgs: </b>The number of ICMP messages received
or sent.</p><p><b>dwErrors: </b>The number of errors that occurred
while sending or receiving ICMP messages.</p><p><b>dwDestUnreachs: </b>The number of
destination-unreachable messages received or sent. A destination-unreachable
message is sent to the originating computer when the destination address in a <a href="fc2dfae9-0d04-4e1d-97c9-c51c2dc06c3b#gt_96ea17cd-226a-48f8-aa14-38d2d3ae60a5" data-linktype="relative-path">datagram</a> cannot be reached.</p><p><b>dwTimeExcds: </b>The number of TTL-exceeded
messages received or sent. A TTL-exceeded message is sent to the originating
computer when a datagram is discarded because the number of routers it has
passed through exceeds its TTL value.</p><p><b>dwParmProbs: </b>The number of parameter-problem
messages received or sent. A parameter-problem message is sent to the
originating computer when a router or host detects an error in a datagram&#39;s IP
header.</p><p><b>dwSrcQuenchs: </b>The number of source quench
messages received or sent. A source quench request is sent to a computer to
request that it reduce its rate of packet transmission.</p><p><b>dwRedirects: </b>The number of redirect messages
received or sent. A redirect message is sent to the originating computer when a
better route is discovered for a datagram sent by that computer.</p><p><b>dwEchos: </b>The number of echo requests received
or sent. An echo request causes the receiving computer to send an echo reply
message back to the originating computer.</p><p><b>dwEchoReps: </b>The number of echo replies received
or sent. A computer sends an echo reply in response to receiving an echo
request message.</p><p><b>dwTimestamps: </b>The number of time stamp
requests received or sent. A time stamp request causes the receiving computer
to send a time stamp reply back to the originating computer.</p><p><b>dwTimestampReps: </b>The number of time stamp
replies received or sent. A computer sends a time stamp reply in response to
having received a time stamp request. Routers can use time stamp requests and
replies to measure the transmission speed of datagrams on a network.</p><p><b>dwAddrMasks: </b>The number of address mask
requests received or sent. A computer sends an address mask request to
determine the number of bits in the subnet mask for its local subnet.</p><p><b>dwAddrMaskReps: </b>The number of address mask
responses received or sent. A computer sends an address mask response in
response to an address mask request.</p></div>
