<div class="content"><p>The routing and remote access service (RRAS) server
management (RRASM) protocol enables remote management (configuration and
monitoring) of a RRAS implementation. The RRAS implementation here refers to
the components that can be configured to provide the following functionality:</p><ul><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Routing</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Remote access service</p>
</li><li><p><span><span> 
</span></span>Site-to-site connectivity</p>
</li></ul><p>The RRASM protocol is a client/server protocol based on
remote procedure call (RPC). It comprises RPC methods that enable the remote
management of an RRAS implementation.</p><p>It also specifies Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)
interfaces that enable the remote management of RRAS implementation. As a part
of remote management of RRAS implementation, a management application uses the
RPC and DCOM methods to manage the RRAS implementation actively (while RRAS is
running).</p><p>This protocol also specifies the registry information that
can be used to specify the overall RRAS configuration. These registry settings
can be managed remotely using the [MS-RRP] protocol. When RRAS is not active,
the configurations are managed through the registry information.</p><p>Additionally, for site-to-site connectivity, the settings to
be used to connect to a remote site are specified in the form of a phonebook
file. This protocol also specifies the format of the phonebook file used by
RRAS server. The management application can use the phonebook file format to
specify the connection configuration to be used for site-to-site connections.</p><p>The client-side Remote Access Service (RAS) is a
point-to-point or point-to-site service that is not in the RRASM protocol. See
legacy information in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2150994" data-linktype="external">[MSDOCS-RRAS]</a>
and <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2150995" data-linktype="external">[MSDOCS-RA-API]</a>.
RAS client uses a different phonebook file; see legacy information in <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2151383" data-linktype="external">[MSDOCS-RASpbk]</a>.</p><p>Sections 1.5, 1.8, 1.9, 2, and 3 of this specification are normative.
