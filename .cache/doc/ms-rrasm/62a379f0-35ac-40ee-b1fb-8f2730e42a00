contains information for an IP multicast group address.</p><p><b>GroupAddr: </b>The IP multicast group address for
which this entry contains information.</p><p><b>IpAddr: </b>The IP address of the interface.</p><p><b>GroupUpTime: </b>The time, in seconds, since the
group membership was up.</p><p><b>GroupExpiryTime: </b>The time, in seconds, before
the group membership expires.</p><p><b>LastReporter: </b>The IP address of the source of
the last membership report received for this IP multicast group address on this
interface. If no membership report has been received, this object has the value
0.0.0.0.</p><p><b>V1HostPresentTimeLeft: </b>The time remaining
until the local router will assume that there are no longer any IGMP version 1
members on the IP subnet attached to this interface. Upon hearing any IGMPv1
membership report, this value is reset to the group membership timer. While
this time remaining is nonzero, the local router ignores any IGMPv1 leave
messages for this group that it receives on this interface.</p><p><b>Flags: </b>This MUST be 0x1000 if IGMPv3
information is available and a <b>IGMP_MIB_GROUP_INFO_V3</b> structure MUST be
used. All other values have no meaning.</p><p><b>Version: </b>The IGMP version. It MUST be 3.</p><p><b>Size: </b>The size of the structure.</p><p><b>FilterType: </b>Indicates whether the sources
specified need to be included or excluded. It MUST be either EXCLUSION
(0x00000000) or INCLUSION (0x00000001).</p><p><b>V2HostPresentTimeLeft: </b>The time remaining
until the local router will assume that there are no longer any IGMP version 2

membership report, this value is reset to the group membership timer. While
this time remaining is nonzero, the local router ignores any IGMPv2 leave
messages for this group that it receives on this interface.</p><p><b>NumSources: </b>The number of entries of <b>IGMP_MIB_GROUP_SOURCE_INFO_V3</b>.</p><p><b>Sources: </b>The <b>IGMP_MIB_GROUP_SOURCE_INFO_V3</b>
